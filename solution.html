```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 flex-1">Item 1</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 flex-1">Item 2</div>
</div>
```
This solution utilizes Tailwind's `flex-1` utility class. Applying `flex-1` to each item instructs the flexbox to distribute available space equally among the items.  Now, each div will expand to fill half of the container's width.
