```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">Item 1</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">Item 2</div>
</div>

This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style two divs within a flex container.  However, it might produce unexpected results if you don't understand how Tailwind's `flex` utility works.  Specifically, without further configuration, the items within a flex container will, by default, take up only as much space as their content requires.
